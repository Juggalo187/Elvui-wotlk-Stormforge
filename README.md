# ElvUI

This is ElvUI. Modified for Stormeforge Frostmourne Server and possible Warmane. But I'm only doign my testign on Frostmourne

I added some features to the bag module. and a set laod distance option for nameplates.
But to use the nameplate load distance you would need to use AwesomeWotlkPatch
