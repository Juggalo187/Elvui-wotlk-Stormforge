# ElvUI

This is ElvUI modified for Stormeforge Frostmourne Server and possibly Warmane servers. But I'm only doing my testing on Frostmourne.

I added some features to the bag module. and a set laod distance option for nameplates.
But to use the nameplate load distance you would need to use AwesomeWotlkPatch
